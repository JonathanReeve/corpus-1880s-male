 touched responsive chord 
 grown old saw 
old broken look burthen life

 ii 

bear patiently heavy
 took hand word led 
pressed heart sobbing
 weary child crept mother side 
aid consolation weary spirit body
 shattered tempesttossed harbour
 peace silence sacred rest peace 
pure joys remedies wounded heart 
 leave seek disturb sacrum
silentium prying eye officious chronicle 
 medicaments work
 give peace serenity happiness
 happiness tempered sad recollections 
bounded modest hopes heretofore 

 failures prophecy
 yearnings bitter tears
 fair true grasp
