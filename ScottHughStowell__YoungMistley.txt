 time trodden

 deck manofwar recollections
 dated days 
 crimea loosened old silk comforter
 took place topcoat 
 spare frame 

 ready 

 sail half hour

 sailor looked smooth
water land gently green
 treeclad blue heights 
dartmoor shadow fear 
 clear eyes sign flinching 
dreary years knew facing 
 stood side side old 
 voyage troubled sea 
nearly bad weather 
beating head wind 
 sailor tall stalwart 
 painfully selfcontained 
companion met stress 
 journey

 talked little usual scrappy

unsatisfactory manner laurance
lowe beckoned boatman haul upto
 ladder

 turned looked round vessel
 raised solemn eyes 
 companion face unusually
wide open noted pale blueness
 returned gaze

 suppose old slowly 
suppose wave hand
 designated vessel 
 object ambition 

 finished sentence shadow
 smile seen 
eyes move white moustache
 narrow beard

 reply turned
 take letters hand 
quartermaster waited 
 quarterdeck answering 
companion vague question

 

 objects life 
 

laurance lowe waited silently 
continue

 looked round vessel 
critically

 

 murmured lowe standing front
 looking motionless
face lifeless eyes

 continued sailor
slowly meeting gaze 
 


 lowe softly held 
 hand farewell
