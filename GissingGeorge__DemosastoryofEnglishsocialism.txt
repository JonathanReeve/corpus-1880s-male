finally support life
 offended 
 shrink expected
years ago loved knowing
 really meant flung away 
 boyish madness 

 consecrated 
 winning contemptible
 eyes â worse loathe
 late understood 
 done loved loves
 woman supremely reverences
 believe 
 saying
 happier speaking 
 remember 
 life 

 bosom heaved excess 
 give power deal lightly 
 gift offered 

 
time 
 tone question merest
curiosity realise 
passed lips

 distance 
 began speak money 
 lead 
 opposite effect showed cold
 natural 
 sympathies entirely remote 
 ago talked 
interests mine 
gan understand suppress side 
 nature useless 
world life purpose

 vain 
 feed convictions
 purposes feel 
opposed mine intellect 
 live passion different
 apart

 glad
 

glad speak 
 tongue aloud 
 repeating 
 mere despair

 step nearer 

 disregard differences 
 intellect 
 distance
 ends 
 past present mine
 
 law â 


 easily 
searched face eyes fire 
 heart passionate
triumph untruth years fell 
 veil achieved womanhood
