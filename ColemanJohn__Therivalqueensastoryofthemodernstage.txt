dust thou dust returned
ne'er spoken soul

 clerehead strolls mutters half unconsciously
 poor poor 
 blessed bard says

 died 

 breaks leads
 away blanc raises 
 ground pass silently 
sadly forth â vicar sexton follow

 remain dead â quite


 word 
sign look hours sea

 perchance 
 look face hear voice


 mad dream 
splendour beauty affluence 
genius bestow passing 
 â brow furrowed care
 hair sprinkled snow
 old time â old
 worn broken hopeless friendless
 henceforth 

 dared 
 â 

 despair desolation bow 
weary head stone marks
poor grave utterly unmanned
 break weep â weep 
child

 awake dreaming 

 soft arm steals neck â soft
cheek nestles mine â soft voice
murmurs ear â

 â 
 live 

 feel heart beating 
 loving lips mine

ah dream 
reality 

 life death time nay 
eternity recall loving
 steal kisses lips 

 red blood rushes 
west flooding sky sea shore 
 burning beams vanishes 
coming gloom

 heart full 

 silent

 corncrake ceased croak 
frogs yonder pool nightingale
 ceased sing

 darling murmurs softly â

 â night fallen darkness
 gathering er deep

 answer â

 hush hush darkness 
 light life 
 evermore 

 spoke answer 
 bright clear 
 stars came countless myriads
glittering vast coronal jewels 
 boundless brow night

 hand hand heart heart
 passed forth outward onward 
 â please god 
 life 

 end
